This project was done as a part of the cource project COMPSCI 687. We have implemented REINFORCE with baseline, Actor critic episodic method and PPO and have discussed and benchmarked the performance of these methods on environments provided by the Open AI gymnasium toolkit. 


## Reinforce with baseline results : 


## Actor critic results : 


## Proximal policy optimization :
